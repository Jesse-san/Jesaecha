subtitle: Navy Corspman to Economic Researcher
---
Hello! My name is Jesse Saechao and I am a Masters Economics student and Navy Veteran  who loves cycling, cooking, story-rich video games, and working with data to make economic driven decisions. I am particularly interested in working with energy and the public sector. 

#### Background
Before my transition to economics, I served 5 years in the Navy as a Medical Laboratory Technician. Laboratory medicine sounds disjoint from economics and analytics, but I assure you that it's not! A feverent attention to detail is absoluteley necessary in the multitude of complex, analytic tasks that are performed in lab-medicine, along with an endless myriad of new biochemical processes and procedures to learn. Constant learning has easily translated to my passion for economics and has led me to California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo to earn my MS in Economics.
