subtitle: Navy Corspman to Economic Researcher and Energy Demand Forecasting
---
I am a Navy Veteran forecasts Solar energy load and energy demand for a living. I love cycling, cooking, story-rich video games, and working with data to make impactful decisions. I am particularly interested in working with energy, econometrics, finance, and any other industry that involves creative problem-solving to make the world better one regression at a time.

My past experiences consist of growing bacteria on petri dishes and analyzing biomedical data, to time-series analysis on housing prices, consulting for the World Bank IFC branch, and forecasting energy demand. My diverse background encompasses the Military, Healthcare, Data Analytics, Statistics, Econometrics, and Energy which make me an adaptable and quick learner. These traits and experiences have helped me thrive as a Corspman in the Navy and a Masters Economics student. 

#### Background
Before my transition to economics, I served 5 years in the Navy as a Medical Laboratory Technician. Laboratory medicine sounds disjoint from economics and analytics, but I assure you that it's not! A feverent attention to detail is absoluteley necessary in the multitude of complex, analytic tasks that are performed in lab-medicine, along with an endless myriad of new biochemical processes and procedures to learn. Constant learning has easily translated to my passion for economics and has led me to California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo to earn my MS in Economics.
