title: About me
subtitle: Navy Corspman to Economic Researcher
---
I am a Navy Veteran who recently graduated with a Masters in Quantitative Economics from Cal Poly SLO. I love cycling, cooking, story-rich video games, and working with data to make impactful decisions. I am particularly interested in working with energy, econometrics, finance, and any other industry that involves creative problem-solving to make the world better one regression at a time.

My past experiences consist of growing bacteria on petri dishes and analyzing biomedical data, to time-series analysis on housing prices and consulting for the World Bank IFC branch. My diverse background encompasses the Military, Healthcare, Data Analytics, Statistics, Econometrics, and Finance which make me an adaptable and quick learner. These traits and experiences have helped me thrive as a Corspman in the Navy and a Masters Economics student. 

#### Background
Before my transition to economics, I served 5 years in the Navy as a Medical Laboratory Technician. Laboratory medicine sounds disjoint from economics and analytics, but I assure you that it's not! A feverent attention to detail is absoluteley necessary in the multitude of complex, analytic tasks that are performed in lab-medicine, along with an endless myriad of new biochemical processes and procedures to learn. Constant learning has easily translated to my passion for economics and has led me to California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo to earn my MS in Economics.
