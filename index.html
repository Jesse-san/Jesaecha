Hello! My name is Jesse Saechao and I am a Masters Economics student and Navy Veteran who loves cycling, cooking, story-rich video games, 
and working with data to make economic driven decisions. I am particularly interested in working in energy, econometrics, finance, the public sector,
and any other industry that involves creative technical analysis to make data-driven decisions.
